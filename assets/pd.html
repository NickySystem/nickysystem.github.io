    <title>Reflections on Pure Data and Identity</title>

      I was introduced to Pure Data (Pd) by a co-worker. It’s a programming environment, primarily for audio and music. It does handle text and numbers too. There are externals for video and image manipulation too. I like the vanilla version with nothing attached. Its simple and if I want to do something complicated I have to learn how to make it happen without help.

It became quite a key part of my identity as a creative person very quickly. Any idea that I had around music, I could now do. The projects I envisioned I could never do, due to technical ability, were all now within reach. However, I didn’t really use it for a long time.  The possibilities were there but I was in my 20s and there was a lot of distraction.

I made a ps2 controller into an instrument first. Two oscillators controlled by the thumb sticks. The buttons played drum samples. It was pretty useless but a huge step for me. 

The big change it made for me was around my thinking. I would come across problems to be solved in making music. These were mathematic or logic problems. I found my brain coming up with solutions sub-consciously sometimes months later. I think this is pretty normal when people learn about programming. I became less interested in song writing and more interested in system design for music.

I think it was around 2017/18 I stumbled across a video of Gabrielle Vinazza, an Argentinian philosophy teacher. He was using an object in Pd call the expression object. Here’s what it can do.

He was typing all these very complicated looking maths expressions into it and it made sound. The aesthetic beauty of it floored me. I’d never seen such a literal application of the ‘music is maths’ idea. He later wrote a piece for Toplap about aesthetic philosophy, accessibility and bytebeat. I was hooked. I studied his videos. At some point he did a tutorial in Spanish. I turned on subtitles and auto translate and followed as best I could. Words like division (in relation to numbers) became ‘separate’. It was hard. I practiced everyday for about year. I did these weird bleeps and square wave bloops at an experimental music night in town. I made a mistake, forgetting to close a parenthesis and it went silent. No room for error in this system. A system that turned into Rampcode.

During Covid I was talking online with other electronic musicians in the regional town that I live in. They were organising a gig and I put my hand up to play. It was this amazing night at a very cool winery after the first lockdown finished in Victoria. People were desperate to come out. I was very scared of making a mistake. Imixed this bytebeat style system I still call rampcode with some live sample manipulation and it became kind of like eight bit house music.
I played and made no syntactical errors, however, the battery died on my Kaos Mini and I had a seven minute panic mid set. I played samples of digital noise to on my sp-505 sampler to hide the confusion and picked up the pieces. It was overall a good experience.

Pd and the expression object was now my instrument. I eventually played again and did a flawless set, from my perspective anyway. I was given feedback that I needed to move more (nope), also someone said that I needed to make Pd look better. That it was too boring. I have played at art galleries, run workshops and did an online gig during another lockdown. It feels very natural now. An extension like guitar used to be. I love doing it. I project my Pd patch onto a wall while playing. People can dance or come and chinstroke at expressions like:

($v1/($v1/6000%4)*($v1%1000%4)%2)*(1-$v1%1000/1000)* 0.5;

That one is quite catchy.

At some point I came to the realisation I was non-binary and felt a little less comfortable performing in the spotlight. A changing identity was always captured and it made me uncomfortable.

I’d recently seen ORCA and became interested in making things for others to use. I imagined what it might be like to have someone discover new ways to use something I’d made. To make things purely for others. I started working on a program called Hedjam. The details of Hedjam’s development are another epic story. 

In a nutshell, it uses Pd as the audio engine but the front end looks like a 2d pixel art video game. Changes to music are made via dialogue with virtual band members. Pd is invisible, chugging along in the background. I had become less interested in system design and more interested in user experience and interfacing with the systems I made.

I learned how to use Pd an audio engine for other things that I built. It can be embedded in hardware and software using libPd. I later made a text interface system in the command line (to me, text feels intuitive for music interaction) that speaks to a Pd patch. I don’t forsee a future music project that I couldn’t implement Pd in. I still use it when making recorded music for DIY plugins and custom patches that are unique. I’ve used it to automate generative remixing. I even did some reactive usb microscopy, sounds changing with the little creatures I collected in puddles. Pd helped me find myself and grow beyond that. And it’s just software.
